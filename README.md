This project just contains tests, code snippets, etc. all written as Go tests, usually table-driven tests.

Using tests like this allows using the IDE to quickly run a single test.  For example GoLand allows you to click in the gutter next to one line of the table of tests to just run that test.  This also makes it very easy to add nwe tests or variations of existing tests and run them without writing any code.

See my presentation at  [Using Tests for Snippets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xY6NBQWX--jTtCL125OoKtid8BhUzBkEj1O8wV6FjkA/edit#slide=id.p) for an explanation.
