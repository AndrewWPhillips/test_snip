This project just contains tests, code snippets, etc. all written as Go tests, usually map-based, table-driven tests.

This setup allows you to easily run a single test from a table. For example, the GoLand IDE allows you to click in the gutter next to one line of the table of tests to run a single test.  Moreover, table-driven tests make it simple to add a new test, or a variation of an existing test, without adding or modifying any code and immediately try it.

See my presentation at  [Using Tests for Snippets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xY6NBQWX--jTtCL125OoKtid8BhUzBkEj1O8wV6FjkA/edit#slide=id.p) for an explanation.
